# 05 - Assembly Evaluation

This tutorial guides you through evaluating the quality and completeness of your hybrid genome assembly for *Leptospira interrogans* serovar Copenhageni using Galaxy. It specifically covers critical assessment metrics including N50, genome coverage, QUAST statistics, and BUSCO completeness assessments.

---

## Objectives

- Evaluate genome assembly quality using standard metrics (N50, genome coverage).
- Assess assembly completeness with QUAST and BUSCO.

---

## Required Input

- Genome assembly files (`contigs.fasta` or `scaffolds.fasta`) generated by the hybrid assembly performed in the previous tutorial.

## Assembly Evaluation Workflow in Galaxy

### Step 1: Assembly Metrics with QUAST

QUAST provides essential metrics for evaluating genome assemblies, including contiguity and completeness.

1. In Galaxy, locate the **QUAST** tool under the "Assembly" category.
2. Input your assembled genome (`contigs.fasta` or `scaffolds.fasta`).
3. Set parameters:
   - **Minimum contig length**: 500 bp (recommended).
   - **Reference genome**: (Optional) Include a reference genome if available for comparative analysis.
4. Execute QUAST by clicking "Run Tool."

### Interpreting QUAST Results

QUAST outputs a detailed HTML report with metrics:

- **N50**: Indicates assembly contiguity (longer N50 suggests better assembly).
- **Total genome length**: Should approximate the expected genome size (~4.6 Mb for *Leptospira interrogans*).
- **Number of contigs/scaffolds**: Fewer, longer contigs are indicative of higher quality.
- **Genome coverage**: Measures how completely the genome is represented by assembled contigs/scaffolds.

### Step 2: Genome Completeness Assessment with BUSCO

BUSCO evaluates the presence of highly conserved, single-copy genes, providing insights into genome completeness and accuracy.

1. In Galaxy, select the **BUSCO** tool from the "Assembly" or "Annotation" toolset.
2. Input the assembly (`contigs.fasta` or `scaffolds.fasta`).
3. Select the "Bacteria" lineage dataset for benchmarking.
4. Run BUSCO by clicking "Run Tool."

### Interpreting BUSCO Results

BUSCO outputs completeness metrics as percentages:

- **Complete (Single-copy and Duplicated)**: Aim for >90% completeness.
- **Fragmented**: Indicates partially assembled orthologs.
- **Missing**: Indicates absent orthologs, reflecting assembly gaps.

High BUSCO completeness supports robust downstream genomic analyses.

## Next Steps

With your assembly quality and completeness verified, you can proceed to advanced analyses such as genome annotation, functional genomics, and comparative studies.
